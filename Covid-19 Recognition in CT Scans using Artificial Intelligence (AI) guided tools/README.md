## Covid-19 Recognition in CT Scans using Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided tools

AI-guided algorithms have been utilized to screen CT scans for Covid-19 analysis. A total of 1, 810 CT scan datasets have been collected for this project where 1, 267 Covid-19 patients’ and 543 healthy patients’ CT Scans. The pre-trained models InceptionNet V3 and U-net have been used for training purposes. K-fold cross-validation has been used to verify a better model. Our main goal was to show which model can perform better to detect, localize and segment Covid-19 cases using CT scan images so that we can use one or two globalized models for Covid-19 analysis.
