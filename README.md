# Mini-Projects
Small Projects to revise ML, DL Algorithms

# 1. Classification Projects
- **Random Forest, KNN, Log-Regression, ANN**
In summary, the following six machine learning models were developed to classify Autism using 13 selected features from the ABIDE dataset and reducing the subjects to 785. Highest accuracy (84.71 %) and ROC_AUC score (0.74) was achieved by XGBoost algorithm, followed by Random Forest which too was pretty close. The classification report and confusion matrix of the best model is given above.

# 2. Fake Job Detection
    There are around 800 false job descriptions among the 18K job descriptions in the dataset. The information includes both textual and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset has been used to train classification models that can detect spurious job descriptions.

# 3. Donald Trump Trumping
* With the latest developments and improvements in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence, many exacting tasks of Natural Language Processing are becoming facile to implement and execute.  
* hence to Implement and understand NLP concept of **Language Modelling and Text Generation using LSTMs**

- Well i m working on this, will update Soon....

# 4. Semantic Segmentation of lungs from X-ray images 
* A model of the segmentation of the lung region from the x-ray images, the model relies on forming a mask through which that region can be cut.
* **My methodology**
    * Using a pre-trained Model, to extract the characteristics and use it to train to X-ray images dataset to find a mathematical formula that links these characteristics to each other and thus the ability to build the mask as required.
