# Mini-Projects
Small Projects to revise ML, DL Algorithms

# 1. Classification Projects
- **Random Forest, KNN, Log-Regression, ANN**
In summary, the following six machine learning models were developed to classify Autism using 13 selected features from the ABIDE dataset and reducing the subjects to 785. Highest accuracy (84.71 %) and ROC_AUC score (0.74) was achieved by XGBoost algorithm, followed by Random Forest which too was pretty close. The classification report and confusion matrix of the best model is given above.

# 2. Fake Job Detection
    There are around 800 false job descriptions among the 18K job descriptions in the dataset. The information includes both textual and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset has been used to train classification models that can detect spurious job descriptions.

# 3. Donald Trump Trumping
* With the latest developments and improvements in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence, many exacting tasks of Natural Language Processing are becoming facile to implement and execute.  
* hence to Implement and understand NLP concept of **Language Modelling and Text Generation using LSTMs**

- Well i m working on this, will update Soon....

# 4. Semantic Segmentation of lungs from X-ray images 
* A model of the segmentation of the lung region from the x-ray images, the model relies on forming a mask through which that region can be cut.
* **My methodology**
    * Using a pre-trained Model, to extract the characteristics and use it to train to X-ray images dataset to find a mathematical formula that links these characteristics to each other and thus the ability to build the mask as required.

# 5. Multi-Class Sentiment Analysis from Tweets 
* here in this project I learnt the mechanism by which we can aggregate Tweets based on sentiment. The aggregation process is based on the association of tweets with the same feelings, as well as the degree and proportion of the feeling.
* **My methodology**
    *  By building a recurrent neural network capable of analyzing sentiment, using a data set that includes a number of emotions. 
    * The next stage involves using the trained model to sort tweets based on sentiment with a rating ratio.
