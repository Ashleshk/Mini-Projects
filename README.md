# 1. Classification Projects

In summary, the following six machine learning models were developed to classify Autism using 13 selected features from the ABIDE dataset and reducing the subjects to 785. Highest accuracy (84.71 %) and ROC_AUC score (0.74) was achieved by XGBoost algorithm, followed by Random Forest which too was pretty close. The classification report and confusion matrix of the best model is given above.
