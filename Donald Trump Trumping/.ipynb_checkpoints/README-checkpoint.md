# Donald Trump Trumping

[**Project Title: Donald Trump Tweet Generator using LSTM**](https://github.com/Ashleshk/Mini-Projects/tree/main/Donald%20Trump%20Trumping)

**Problem Statement/Background:**
- Replicating the unique tweeting style of former President Donald J. Trump using artificial intelligence.

**Work:**
- Utilized a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze a dataset of Donald Trump's previous tweets.
- Trained the LSTM model to generate new tweets that closely resemble Trump's distinctive writing style.

**Result:**
- Developed a tweet generator that produces highly realistic tweets emulating Trump's writing patterns, vocabulary, and tone.
- Showcased the potential of deep learning algorithms in capturing and replicating the writing styles of influential individuals.
